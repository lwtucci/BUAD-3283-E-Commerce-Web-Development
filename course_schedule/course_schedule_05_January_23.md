[There are quite a few GIU tools for getting code into source control.](https://git-scm.com/download/gui/windows) When working with [GitHub](https://github.com/) it seems that the easiest route to take would be to use [Atom](https://atom.io/) for edits, then use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for interacting with your remote repository. The tools a developer picks to complete a task or solve a problem is largely immaterial as long as the end result is successful.
