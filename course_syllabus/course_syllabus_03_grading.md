## Grading

Your final grade is based on a straight point calculation: points earned/points offered.  However, participation and attendance will be considered, but only if it will help your grade.

| Grade | Percentage           |
|-------|----------------------|
| A     | 90% and up           |
| B     | 80-89%               |
| C     | 70-79%               |
| D     | 60-69%               |
| F     | 59% and below (fail) |
