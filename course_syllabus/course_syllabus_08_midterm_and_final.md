## Midterm and Final

There will be a midterm project that will be due at a date to be assigned by the instructor.  The final examination will actually be the completion of the project that you will be working on throughout the entire semester.  This means it is **VERY IMPORTANT** to keep up with what is required for the project, and not wait until the last minute to try to do everything. This is your warning.

### Note
The professor reserves the right to offer unannounced quizzes and assignments, and/or activities at any time.
