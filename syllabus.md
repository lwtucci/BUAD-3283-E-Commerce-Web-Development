<html lang="en">
<!-- Start instructions for page -->
<head>
    <!-- Page Encoding -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!-- Title of page -->
    <title>Title</title>
    <!-- Link to a external stylesheet -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/link/to/a/style/sheet.css">
    <!-- Link to a external JavaScript file -->
    <script type="application/javascript" src="/link/to/a/page/blocking/js/file.js"></script>
    <!-- Embedded JavaScript -->
    <script type="application/javascript">
      console.log('Hello World');
    </script>
</head>
<!-- End instructions for page -->
<!-- Start visual part of page -->
<body>
  <img src="/path/to/an/image.png" alt="This is the alt text for this image if it is missing." />
  <p>Hello World</p>
  <script type="application/javascript" src="/link/to/a/non/page/blocking/js/file.js"></script>
</body>
<!-- End visual part of page -->
</html>

```

##### Parts

###### Tags
* They include paragraph, lists, tables, etc.
* They either require open and close tags or are self closing
    * Open and close: `<p>Hello World</p>`
    * Self closing: `<img src="/path/to/an/image.png" alt="This is the alt text for this image if it is missing." />`
* They have attributes: `<img src="image.png" alt="Alt text" />`, `src` and `alt` are attributes.

###### DOCTYPE
* Many different HTML DOCTYPE Declaration depending on the type of document https://www.w3.org/QA/2002/04/valid-dtd-list.html
* **The standard now is the HTML5 DOCTYPE** `<!DOCTYPE html>`

###### HTML
  * Body and head are wrapped with `<html></html>`
  * Sets the language of page with the `lang` attribute https://w3c.github.io/html/dom.html#the-lang-and-xmllang-attributes

###### Head
* Contained within `<head></head>`
* Includes instructions for the page
  * Example: `<meta charset="UTF-8">` Tells the browser to use `UTF-8` character encoding for the HTML page.
* Include external CSS and JS
* Meta tags used by browser, search spiders, screen readers, etc.  

###### Body
* Contains the visual output of the page

### January 18th

#### Discussion
  * Files for a web site
  * Structural / Semantic tags

#### Assignment

See [course_assignment/course_assignment_04_January_18.md](https://github.com/natenolting/BUAD-3283-E-Commerce-Web-Development/blob/spring2018/course_assignment/course_assignment_04_January_18.md)


#### Files for a web site

##### Index

* `index.html`, `index.php`, others depending on server language
* Entry point of web site

##### Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)

* `.css` file extension
* Holds styling for the site
* Linked in the head typically with `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/link/to/css/file.css">`

##### Javascript

* `.js` file extension    
* Might be library file or a custom script
* Linked in the head or at the end of the body tags in the HTML with `<script src="/link/to/script.js"></script>`

##### Other Files

* `.htaccess` for Apache server instructions
* `robots.txt` for instructions given to search engines http://www.robotstxt.org/
* Verification files for 3rd party tools, ie. Google Analytics

#### Structural / Semantic tags

##### Structural Tags

* Meant for layout of a web page
* Typically are block elements
* Give structure to pages
* Used for header, footer, navigation, articles, etc.
* Include `div`, `p`, `ul`, `ol`, `h1` &#8594; `h6`, `br`, `hr`, `table`, etc.

##### Semantic Tags

* Meant to describe elements
* Used inside structural elements to give content more meaning
* Typically bad practice to include structural elements inside a semantic tag: `<p><strong>I'm strong</strong></p>` rather than `<strong><p>I'm strong but invalid</p></strong>`
* Include `em`, `strong`, `code`, `blockquote`, `span`, and many more  
* Just pick the tag that seems the most appropriate

##### Tables

* Typically only of tabular data
* Starts with `table` with rows `tr` that wrap a list of columns `td`
* Head row has `th` column tags

**Table example**

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Foo</th>
    <th>Bar</th>
    <th>Baz</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Foo</td>
    <td>Bar</td>
    <td>Baz</td>
  </tr>
</table>

```
Makes:

| Foo | Bar | Baz |
|-----|-----|-----|
| Foo | Bar | Baz |


##### Lists

* Unordered `ul` creates a bulleted list by default
* Ordered `ol` create a numbered list by default
* List items wrapped with `li` tags

**Link example**

```
<ul>
  <li>Foo</li>
  <li>Bar</li>
  <li>Bazz</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Foo</li>
  <li>Bar</li>
  <li>Bazz</li>
</ul>

```

Makes:

* Foo
* Bar
* Bazz


1. Foo
2. Bar
3. Bazz


##### Links

* Links can act as semantic or structural
* Links can link to different pages and target specific place on a page
* Links can target an app, open an email message, prompt a phone call, etc.

**Link Examples**

```html

<!-- link to another page -->
<a href-"/link/to/another/page.html">Link to another page</a>

<!-- link to an external page -->
<a href="https://google.com">Link to Google</a>

<!-- link to a specific point on a page... -->
<a href="#anchor">Link to an anchor</a>
<!-- ...then at the point that the above should link to -->
<a name="anchor" id="anchor"></a>

<!-- link that opens an email -->
<a href="mailto:somone@example.com">Link to Email</a>

<!-- link to call a number -->
<a href="tel:1234567890">Call a number</a>

```

### January 23rd

#### Discussion

##### Source Control

* Discussion on how to get code changes into the cloud on GitHub.

![Atom to GitHub Desktop to GitHub](http://www.natenolting.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/source-code.png)

[There are quite a few GIU tools for getting code into source control.](https://git-scm.com/download/gui/windows) When working with [GitHub](https://github.com/) it seems that the easiest route to take would be to use [Atom](https://atom.io/) for edits, then use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for interacting with your remote repository. The tools a developer picks to complete a task or solve a problem is largely immaterial as long as the end result is successful.
